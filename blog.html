    				I have to start at the very beginning it's a very good place to start<br />
    				To start a new web page I open Google Chrome and Sublime Text<br />
    				I then click on 'New File' in Sublime Text then I click on 'Save As'<br />
    				I then choose where my file must be located and type in "Blog.HTML" and I click on save<br />
    				I then start the new Sublime Text document with the word 'HTML' enclosed in brackets<br />
    				Then on the next line I add the 'Head' to state that my document has a header<br/>
    				Then I must give my page a Heading Title with the words 'title' in brackets to show that this is the title followed by the Name of the page then followed by another 'title'<br/>
    			</div>
    		</div>

    		<div class="panel panel-default">
  				<div class="panel-heading" style="background-color: #FF0000;">
    				<div class="pull-right">2017-01-23</div>
    				<h3 class="panel-title">My Second Post!</h3>
  				</div>
    			<div class="panel-body" style="background-color: #ffff99;">
    			I must decorate my page<br/>
    			I have discovered another webpage called 'bootstrap' where I will be getting alot of my ideas from<br/>
    			In google chrome I typed in the search window 'bootstrap style sheets' and chose the 'getbootstrap.com website'<br/>
    			I then scrolled down to find the stylesheet section and copied the information I found there<br/>
    			I then came back to my worksheet and Pasted what I found there<br/>
    			This sets the style for the whole web page<br/>
    			I then added 'head/' in brackets to show that I was done with my header<br/>
    			I must ensure that I remember to start each new paragragh with 'div' in brackets<br/>
    			</div>
			</div>

			<div class="panel panel-default">
  				<div class="panel-heading" style="background-color: #FF0000;">
  					<div class="pull-right">2017-01-23</div>
    				<h3 class="panel-title">My Third Post!</h3>
  				</div>
  				<div class="panel-body" style="background-color: #99ff99;">
    			Now if I understand this correctly I must add the word 'div' to show that a new paragraph is being used<br/>
    			I must add 'body' in brackets to indicate that I am now starting on the contents of my web page<br/>
    			After this I start a new line again with the 'div' tag followed by the description of what I want my page to look like<br/>
    			Now is where it gets interesting<br/>
    			I must show that each paragragh is a 'box' and each 'box' has lots of 'little boxes'<br/>
    			The 'box' is a classification 'class'<br/>
    			The little boxes are 'containers'<br/>
				</div>

  				<div class="panel-heading" style="background-color: #FF0000;">
  					<div class="pull-right">2017-01-24</div>
    				<h3 class="panel-title">My Fourth Post!</h3>
  				</div>
  				<div class="panel-body" style="background-color: #ff80b3; font color: #19194d">
    			Right it is a new day and I must say I think I am getting the hang of this<br/>
    			Although, Shaun did tell me that what I have learned here is just the raw basics and there is still a long road ahead<br/>
    			I started explaining yesterday about the 'boxes'<br/>
    			Well I was only partially right<br/>
    			I have to think of it this way, the 'boxes'are the 'class' and the 'container' is the removals truck<br/>
    			Each web page has twelve columns, either 2x8x2=12 or 4x4x4<br/>
    			I have learned to change the backround colour using redredgrreengreenblueblue RRGGBB with a hashtag smbol in the front<br/>
    			I use the style = background colour and then I go onto the colour picker website and find the colour that I want and copy and paste the number<br/>	
    			I can also change the colour of font using the style = font colour<br/>
    			I must ensure that I open and close tags<br/>
